    Yashavant has recently been honored with the prestigious “Distinguished Alumnus Award” by IIT Kanpur for his entrepreneurial, 
professional and academic excellence. This award was given to top 50 
alumni of IIT Kanpur who have made significant contribution towards 
their profession and betterment of society in the last 50 years. 
In this I have reorganized the contents of the book in a major way. After 
going through the thirteenth edition several times I decided to realign all 
the chapters in such a manner that if a C programming course is taught 
using Let Us C, it can roughly be finished in 23 lectures of one hour each, 
with one chapter's contents devoted to one lecture. I hope this would 
make the learning path trouble-free. Some end-of-chapter exercises in 
the book needed a second look to make them more practical. That also 
stands done now. 
Many readers told me that they have immensely benefitted from the 
inclusion of the chapter on Interview FAQs. I have improved this chapter 
further. The rationale behind this chapter is simple—ultimately all the 
readers of Let Us C sooner or later end up in an interview room where 
they are required to take questions on C programming. I now have a 
proof that this chapter has helped to make that journey smooth and 
fruitful.
